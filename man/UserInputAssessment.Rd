}
\arguments{
\item{LatLongs}{a matrix of n rows by 2 columns where n is the number of reference specimens in your dataset and the columns are Latitude and Longitude values in that order. These latitude-longitude coordinates should be of the locations of the reference specimens.}

\item{RefDistMat}{is a square matrix of pairwise distances among all reference specimens.}

\item{RefData}{is a matrix of Reference specimen data where the rows are the individual reference specimens and the columns are the variables in the same order as the TargetData vector.}

\item{LongRange}{is a vector of 2 elements defining the maximum and minimum Longitude values that the provenancing method should explore. This will also define the mapping range in the final plotted output.}

\item{LatRange}{is a vector of 2 elements defining the maximum and minimum Latitude values that the provenancing method should explore. This will also define the mapping range in the final plotted output.}

\item{RangeSamp}{is an integer vector of 1 or 2 elements that defines the resolution of spatial sampling. If one element is provided then both the latitude and longitude ranges are equally and evenly sampled using this value. If 2 elements are provided they should be in the order of latitude longitude and each range will be evenly sampled with its respective value.}

\item{Method}{determines what kind of correlation coefficient should be used, either "Spearman" or "Pearson". Spearman's ranked correlation coefficient does not assume a linear relationship between geographic and trait distances, whereas Pearson's coefficient does.}
